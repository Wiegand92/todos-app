# Todos-App

## About

This is a project for the Javascript bootcamp by Andrew Mead on Udemy. A simple todo app that allows you to add, delete, mark done, and filter through todos.

## What I learned

This project was my first step in to Local Storage. Also a jump back in to functional apps after spending a while just writing snippets of code. 

## RoadMap

Might update the css a bit in the future. Please let me know if you spot any bugs. I would also like to add a testing environment at some point, as well as setting individual id's for the tasks
