## About

This is a project for the Javascript bootcamp by Andrew Mead on Udemy. A simple todo app that allows you to add, delete, mark done, and filter through todos.

## What I learned

This project was my first step in to Local Storage. Also a jump back in to functional apps after spending a while just writing snippets of code. 

## RoadMap

 - Click on incomplete todos to edit text
 - Click on complete todos to mark incomplete

## Technologies used
